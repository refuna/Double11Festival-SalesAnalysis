## Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following insights and recommendations can help optimize marketing strategies for future Double 11 sales campaigns:

1. **Focus on Basic Skincare Products**: With cleansing products, toners, and creams leading the sales, brands should focus their promotions on these items. Offering bundles of basic skincare products or discounts on staple items could further boost sales.

2. **Target Male Consumers with Skincare**: Given the popularity of skincare products among male consumers, brands should develop and promote more male-oriented skincare lines. The success of Nivea highlights the opportunity for similar brands to gain market share.

3. **Emphasize Affordable Pricing**: Consumers are highly sensitive to price, especially for basic beauty products. Highlighting affordable options during promotional campaigns will attract budget-conscious buyers.

4. **Optimize Pre-Sale Campaigns**: Since many consumers choose to shop before the official Double 11 date, merchants should continue **early promotions and pre-sale strategies**. Pre-order discounts and early bird deals can help capture demand before competitors.

5. **Maintain Post-Festival Engagement**: Although post-event sales decrease, extending promotions for a few days after Double 11 can still capture lingering demand. Offering special post-sale discounts or flash sales could help merchants maximize sales during this period.
